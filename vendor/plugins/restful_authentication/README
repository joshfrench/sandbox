Restful Authentication Generator
====

This is a basic restful authentication generator for rails, taken from acts as authenticated.  Currently it requires Rails 1.2 (or edge).

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user sessions

The first parameter specifies the model that gets created in signup (typically a user or account model).  A model with migration is created,
as well as a basic controller with the create method.

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the site.

You can pass --skip_migration to skip the user migration.

From here, you will need to add the resource routes in config/routes.rb.  

  map.resources :users, :sessions

Generate your mailer:

  ./script/generate authenticated_mailer user
